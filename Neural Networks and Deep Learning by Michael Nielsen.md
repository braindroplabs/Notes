# Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen

## Intro

- *Neural network* - biologically inspired programming paradigm enabling a computer to learn from observation
- *Deep learning* - techniques for learning in neural networks

## Chapter 1 - Using neural nets to recognize handwritten digits

- Neural networks leverage supplied *training examples* against a programmed system that learns (infers rules for pattern recognition) from the examples
- *Σ* - sigma (sum)
- *Perceptron* - an artificial neuron with x binary inputs and 1 binary output. A *weight* is a real number associated with each input where the *weighted sum (Σ)* meets a real number *threshold* value to determine the output.
    - Varying the weights and threshold result in different *decision making models*
